BACKGROUND \n \nFormerly known as the California Gang Reduction, Intervention & Prevention (CalGRIP) \nGrant Program, the State Legislature established the California Violence Intervention and \nPrevention (CalVIP) Grant Program in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017-18. CalVIP encouraged \njurisdictions to develop local approaches that would meet the diverse needs of each \ncommunity. In 2019, the CalVIP grant was codified as the Break the Cycle of Violence \nAct (Chapter 735, Statutes of 2019) which established the authority and duties of the \nBoard of State and Community Correction (BSCC) to administer CalVIP, including the \nselection criteria for grants and reporting requirements to the Legislature. BSCC has now \nadministered four rounds of CalVIP funding, providing more than $250 million toward local \nviolence intervention and prevention efforts. \n \nEnacted in 2023, Assembly Bill (AB) 762 brought additional changes to the CalVIP Grant, \nspecifying that the purpose of the program is to support effective community gun violence \nreduction initiatives in communities that are disproportionately impacted by community \ngun violence. It expands the CalVIP program to include counties that have within their \njurisdiction one or more cities disproportionately impacted by community gun violence \nand tribal governments. Up to now, the grant has been available only to select California \ncities and the community-based organizations that serve them. And finally, AB 762 \nincreases the maximum grant amount to $2.5 million per year and requires BSCC to make \nat least 20 percent of a grantee\u2019s total award available at the start of the grant period.  \n \nHistorically, the CalVIP program has been funded by the General Fund, at $9 million per \nyear, with several one-time augmentations. Commencing July 1, 2024, Assembly Bill 28 \n(2023), also known as the Gun Violence Prevention and School Safety Act, imposes an \nexcise tax in the amount of 11 percent of the gross receipts from the retail sale in \nCalifornia of a firearm, firearm precursor part, and ammunition. Revenues collected from \nthis fund will be deposited in the Gun Violence Prevention and School Safety Fund and \nthe first $75 million available in the fund, or as much of that amount as is available, shall \nbe continuously appropriated annually to BSCC for the CalVIP Grant Program. For Fiscal \nYears 2024-25 and 2025-26, the Department of Finance estimates that BSCC will receive \n$55 million and $57 million, respectively.  \n \nTo develop a Request for Proposals (RFP), the BSCC convened a diverse group of \nsubject matter experts to serve as an Executive Steering Committee (ESC). The CalVIP \nRFP1 to fund the fifth cohort of grantees was released on February 14, 2025, and \nproposals are due on August 18, 2025.  \n \n \n \n1 The RFP is available at https://www.bscc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CalVIP-RFP-Cohort-5-FINAL-\n2.14.25.pdf .  \nBoard of State and Community Corrections \nCalVIP: Strengthening the Data Collection and Evaluation Capacity of Grantees \nPage 2 of 50 \n \nTable 4.

This is so that \u201csmall\u201d projects compete against other small \nprojects and \u201clarge\u201d projects compete against other large projects. \n \nThe BSCC anticipates awarding funding to approximately 40-45 CalVIP grants. Projects \nwill be funded for a three-year grant project service period commencing January 1, 2026 \nand ending on December 31, 2028. However, an additional six months (January 1, 2029 \nthrough June 30, 2029) will be included in the term of project contracts for the sole \npurpose of finalizing and submitting the required Local Evaluation Report (LER) and \nfinalizing and submitting a required financial audit.    \n \nThe CalVIP grants are designed primarily to reduce the incidences of homicides, \nshootings, and aggravated assaults. Where appropriate, it is anticipated that the projects \nwill track participant data for individuals engaged in ongoing services to include outcomes \ntied to recidivism, victimization, employment, education, behavior, etc.  \n \nB. PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES \n \nPenal Code Section 14131(n) requires the BSCC to submit a report to the Legislature \nregarding the impact of the violence prevention initiatives supported by CalVIP. BSCC \nResearch will conduct the statewide outcome evaluation and provide information about \nthe individual projects funded. The BSCC\u2019s evaluation design:  \nBoard of State and Community Corrections \nCalVIP: Strengthening the Data Collection and Evaluation Capacity of Grantees \nPage 3 of 50 \n \n\u2022 relies on the use of qualitative and aggregate quantitative data obtained from \ngrantees through the BSCC\u2019s Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs), grantees\u2019 Local \nEvaluation Plans (LEPs), and Local Evaluation Reports (LERs).2  \n\u2022 will identify and incorporate relevant, existing, and publicly accessible data for the \npurpose of tracking outcomes (e.g., changes in the incidences of homicides, \nshootings and aggravated assaults in grantee service areas) that may also be \nincluded in the outcome evaluation report.  \n\u2022 recognizes the grantee as the local coordinator for data collection and reporting. \n\u2022 minimizes any evaluation related impacts on the organizations that provide \nservices under the CalVIP Grant Program. \n \nThe Assembly Bill (AB) 28 imposes an 11 percent excise tax from the retail sales in \nCalifornia on the retail sale of a firearm, firearm precursor part, and ammunition. The first \n$75 million annually will be appropriated to the BSCC to administer and evaluate the \nCalVIP grant program, and to fund CalVIP grants. Under Penal Code Section 14131(l)(1), \nthe BSCC may also reserve five percent of the funds to support programs and activities \ndesigned to build and sustain capacity in the field of community gun violence intervention \nand prevention.  \n \nThe BSCC anticipates that the level of evaluation-related experience and expertise \nacross the Cohort 5 grantees will likely vary and strengthening their data collection and \nevaluation capacity will 1) support the BSCC\u2019s statewide outcome evaluation by \nmaximizing and standardizing data collection across all projects for the collection of \nquality data through the QPRs, 2) ensure grantees can collect quality, meaningful data \nfor their project-specific evaluations (LEP and LER); and 3) equip grantees with the \nnecessary skills and knowledge to perform this level of work in the future. \n \nThe purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals from universities, research firms, and \nconsultants to engage in capacity-building with CalVIP Cohort 5 grantees to strengthen \ntheir performance in key evaluation areas, including data collection.  \n \nRespondents to this RFP must include in the proposal a clear description of how they will \nwork with grantees to strengthen their data collection and evaluation capacity, including \ntheir ability to meet the reporting and evaluation requirements of the BSCC (QPR, LEP, \nand LER). Applicants are requested to submit a proposal that:  \n \n1) recognizes the grantee as the local coordinator for data collection, data \nmanagement, and reporting to the BSCC.  \n2) completes the work in consultation with BSCC staff.  \n3) gathers information about the grantees\u2019 projects, technical assistance needs as it \nrelates to data collection and evaluation, and their geographic location. \n \n2 For more information about QPRs, LEPs, and LERs see the CalVIP RFP at https://www.bscc.ca.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/02/CalVIP-RFP-Cohort-5-FINAL-2.14.25.pdf.    \nBoard of State and Community Corrections \nCalVIP: Strengthening the Data Collection and Evaluation Capacity of Grantees \nPage 4 of 50 \n4) develops and administers a data collection and evaluation readiness assessment \nearly in the grant period to help understand the specific evaluation and data \ncollection needs of grantees. \n5) describes the approach(es) that will be used to provide technical assistance to \nCalVIP grantees (e.g., group-based training, direct in-person assistance).  \n6) includes delivery approaches that provide regional technical assistance; are \nresponsive to the varying data and evaluation capacity building needs of grantees; \nand provide in-person, customized technical assistance to a select number of \ngrantees that would benefit the most as determined by the readiness assessment.  \n7) describes an approach to updating the evaluation resources provided by the \nBSCC, including the development of short training videos, infographics, \nbrochures/pamphlets, and data collection tools. \n8) describes an approach and methods for grantees and their evaluators to share \ntheir relevant findings and best practices with one another, grantees, advocates, \nor other interested parties, and the public.  \n9) provides ongoing technical assistance and oversight to grantees for data collection \nand evaluation activities.  \n \nApplicants to this RFP must include in the proposal a clear technical assistance delivery \nplan that includes a description of how they will achieve each of the components listed \nabove and how they will provide each deliverable enumerated below.  \n \nC.
